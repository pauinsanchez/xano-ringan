# First steps

In order to use this template, you must first install the development version of the `xaringan` package in 
[RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/)

```{r eval=FALSE, tidy=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("yihui/xaringan")
```

As this template is not included as part of the package, you'll need to install it manually. 

- Once you have downloaded the package, set a working directory and copy there the files in the xano-ringan repo in Github. 

- Open `model.Rmd` and click the `Knit` button to compile. In the Settings button next to `Knit` you may select if you 
want to see the result of the compilation in a new window or in the RStudio Viewer.

- Voilà!

# Basic usage

The default theme comes with a useful environment for comparisons:

.pull-left[
### Things on the left go here:
1. Start with a boilerplate HTML file

2. Plain Markdown

3. Write JavaScript to autoplay slides

4. Manually configure MathJax

5. Highlight code with
]

.pull-right[
### Things on the right go here:
- Start with an R Markdown document

- R Markdown (can embed R/other code chunks)

- Provide an option `autoplay`

- MathJax just works

- Highlight code with `{{}}`
]

# Math expressions

Including math expressions can be done following the LaTeX grammar. Something within simple dollar signs
renders in-line equations, i.e. $e^{\pi i}+1=0$. Something within double dollar signs renders equations 
in a new line: 

$$\phi=\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}$$

Of course, formulas can be included as code as well:

```
$$\phi=\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}$$
```

Limitations:

1. The source code of a LaTeX math expression must be in one line, unless it is inside a pair of double dollar signs, in which case the starting `$$` must appear in the very beginning of a line, followed immediately by a non-space character, and the ending `$$` must be at the end of a line, led by a non-space character;

1. There should not be spaces after the opening `$` or before the closing `$`.

1. Math does not work on the title slide (see [#61](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan/issues/61) for a workaround).

# R Code

```{r comment='#'}
# a boring regression
fit = lm(dist ~ 1 + speed, data = cars)
coef(summary(fit))
dojutsu = c('地爆天星', '天照', '加具土命', '神威', '須佐能乎', '無限月読')
grep('天', dojutsu, value = TRUE)
```
